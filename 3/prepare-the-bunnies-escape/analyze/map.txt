* w: Width of the map
* h: Height of the map
* Map size = w * h
* m[x][y] can be used to indicate location on map
  - m[0][0], m[h-1][w-1]


# Moves can only be made in cardinal directions; no diagonal moves are allowed.
* Only apply +-1 change to x or y in one move is allowed
* Shortest route: w + h - 1


m[0][0], m[h-1][w-1] must be used
