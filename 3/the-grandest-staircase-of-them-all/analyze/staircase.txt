Requirements:
* Next step has more bricks than the current step, the current step has more bricks thn previous one (if any).

Factors
* n: Bricks
* s: Steps

Calculated
* N: Minimum bricks cost by steps
* r: Remain bricks. r = n - N


Canvas table:
* Left to right
* Denote a brick with 1
* A column is a step

N = s * (1 + s) / 2
* s = 2 -> N = 3.
* s = 3 -> N = 6.
* s = 4 -> N = 10.


Remain bricks make variants of staircase
n = 4, s = 2; N = 3; r = n - N = 1.
No additional variants available, the remain brick can only be attached to the final step.

n = 5, s = 2; N = 3; r = n - N = 2.
Two variants available:
1) All attach to final.
2) Equally attach to final two.

[Pattern] Remain bricks usage following rules to fulfill requirements:
* Remain bricks start using in final step
* Remain bricks used on the current step >= Remain bricks used on the previous step
