Make (num_buns, num_required) have meaning of:

* nB = num_buns
* nR = num_required

* Any num_required of num_buns always hold at least one different key individually.
* Any num_required of num_buns always hold correct keys union but (number < num_required) of num_buns never can.
* Keys unions from any num_required of num_buns are the same.
* Keys sets from any two bunnies are always different when num_required > 1.
* All bunnies hold the same amount of keys
* Amounts of duplicate keys for locks are equal.
  - If lock-0, lock-1 are being used
  - If the number of keys for lock-0 is 2, then the number keys for lock-1 is 2, too.

* nL = number of locks
* nD = a list of numbers of duplicate keys of the corresponding lock
     = Duplicate Keys

-> (nL * nD) % nB == 0


* nL = number of locks
* nD = a list of numbers of duplicate keys of the corresponding lock
     = Duplicate Keys


* nB > Duplicate Keys > nB - nR
* nD = nB - nR + 1
